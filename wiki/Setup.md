# Image Setup

If using the single-image avatar setting, one image must contain the separate avatar visual states either side by side and/or on the top and bottom halves of the image. If an avatar has a blinking animation, it should take up the bottom half of the image. If an avatar has a talking animation, it should take up the right half of the image.
