# Image Setup

## Single Image

You must check the Single Image to true to use single image. One image must contain the separate avatar visual states either side by side and/or on the top and bottom halves of the image. If an avatar has a blinking animation, it should take up the bottom half of the image. If an avatar has a talking animation, it should take up the right half of the image.

## Multiple Images

You must uncheck the Single Image checkbox, it will be multimage by default. For each seprate avatar visual state it would be an image.
