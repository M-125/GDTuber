# Translations

This project uses Godot's built in translation system.

## Translation files

Translations are stored as individual files in the `Translations` directory.

Each language should have its own translation file. This makes managing/debugging individual languages simpler.

## Contributing new translations

 1. To add a new translation, create a new CSV file in the `Translations` directory. 
    1. It is recommended to duplicate an existing translation file (probably English), then replace the language code and all translations in the file.
 2. Once a new translation file is created and the project is opened in Godot, Godot will generate a `.translation` file. That file will need to be added as a translation in the Project settings under Localization -> Translations
